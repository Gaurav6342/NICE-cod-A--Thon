17 Phobia (100 Marks)

Maya is a brilliant student but once she failed in mathematics and got 17 marks out of 100. Since then she has developed a phobia for number 17. She is so disturbed that she gets panic attacks in three conditions:

1. The number is 17

2. The number 17 is a part of a number.

3. The number is divisible by 17

Maya has a very happy face otherwise in any condition. Her friend has a list of numbers with her and she wants your help in determining the numbers on which Maya will get Panic Attack or be Happy Face. She does not want to frighten her friend. Can you help her out?

Input Format

The first line consists of number of test cases, T

Input Format

The first line consists of number of test cases, The only line of each test case consists of a single integer, N.

Constraints

1<=T<=100
 1<=N<=100000

Output Format

For each test case, print if Maya will have Panic Attack or Happy Face

Sample TestCase 1

Input

4
 17

117

85

90

Output

Panic Attack

Panic Attack

Panic Attack

Happy Face

Explanation

Test Case 1: Panic Attack as the number is 17 Test Case 2: Panic Attack as 17 is part of 117.

Test Case 3: Panic Attack as 85 is divisible by 17

Test Case 4: Happy Face as 90 is neither divisible by 17 nor it contains 17 as part of it


Java 8 Code:


import java.util.Scanner;

public class CandidateCode {
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = scanner.nextInt(); // number of test cases

        for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {
            int N = scanner.nextInt(); // input number

            if (N == 17 || contains17(N) || N % 17 == 0) {
                System.out.println("Panic Attack");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Happy Face");
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }

    // Helper function to check if a number contains 17 as part of it
    private static boolean contains17(int number) {
        String str = String.valueOf(number);
        return str.contains("17");
    }
}
